<p align="justify">
The GUI and Control system was designed in LABView, and the Arduino is used as data add-on card. The control positions the system at a specific angle, the sensor that measure this angle is the potenciometer and the signal control (PWM) moves the motor with driver L298.
</p>

## 4. Results

<p align="justify">
The next animation you can see how the VTOL is positioned at a specific angle.
